            The final project demonstrated here was created over the course of three modules - Real Time Rendering Framework (RTRF),
            Applied Mathematics for Games (AMG) and Advanced Real Time Graphics (ARTG).
            As well as this, some extra features have been worked on that have not been relevant to the aforementioned modules.
            <br/><br/>
            RTRF was an introduction into using DirectX 11, wherein were we tasked with creating a simple Engine that
            can render a scene with several different meshes and textures - with a Blinn lighting shader.
            <br/>
            This version of the engine was very simplistic - with each object having to be programmatically added to the scene.
            This would require a recompilation of the project each time a value was changed. As well as this, it required
            passing many variables to a factory class that would handle the creation of each object - meaning that each
            object type was explicitly different.
            <br/><br/>
            AMG required adding Physics to a framework - I chose to use my previous project for this - with a fairly basic
            physic model being implemented - Gravity,
            <br/><br/>
            ARTG deferred here
