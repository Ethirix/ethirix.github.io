        <p>
            This project was created across eight weeks in a team of nine - each with their own tasks to build out the cross-platform engine.
            <br/><br/>
            My tasks were primarily focused in the overall architecture of the engine - determining how the Scene Graph, Game Object and Component systems worked.
            As well as this, I also developed the Windows platform DirectX 11 renderer and worked on some parts of the Maths Library.
            <br/><br/>
            The project overall is capable of compiling to Windows and PlayStation 5 with Windows containing a platform-specific feature of Lighting - purely to demonstrate there
            can be differences.
            As well as this, the Component facilitates expanding the engine to do, functionally, whatever a developer requires. This allows the project to support such features as Physics,
            Pathfinding and Task-based AI.
            <br/><br/>
            Below is an explanation of the features I worked on and how they function.
        </p>

        <h2 class="major centerTitle">Specifics of Features Implemented</h2>
        <h3 class="major centerTitle">Maths Library</h3>
        <p>
            A Maths Library is a critical feature of a cross-platform engine as many core features will rely on the functions and structs that are present within.
            I designed how the Maths Library works as well as added some of the functionality.
            <br/><br/>
            The functionality I added was Vector2, Vector3 and Vector4 classes. These each overloaded the +, -, *, /, +=, -=, *=, /=, == and != operators.
            As well as this, each class also contained functions, as well as static functions, to calculate dot, angle, magnitude, magnitude squared and vector normalized.
            <br/>
            Each one also contained static initializers for One and Zero, returning vectors that are prefilled with values. Vector2 and Vector3 also contain Up, Down,
            Left and Right initializers with Vector3 also containing Forward and Back - contextually indicating that Vector2 and Vector3 are used for 2D and 3D coordinate spaces.
            <br/><br/>
            Functions to calculate orthogonal projection and look-to view matrices were also added, although, many of the values that would be used were not, as the engine is
            specifically targeting 2D rendering.
        </p>
        <h3 class="major centerTitle">Renderer - DirectX 11</h3>
        <p>
            The DirectX 11 Renderer is the primary renderer of the project, with a different renderer having to be used for the PlayStation 5 Port of the Project.
            <br/><br/>
            The Renderers were implemented are in a way that means a specifical renderer could be conditionally compiled for the platform. The header file for the renderer
            acts as an interface for each renderer. Then, the implementation is linked at compile time - through selecting the implementation file.
            <br/><br/>
            As the project is 2D and sprite-based, the renderer interface was specialised to simply being able to call renderer::draw_sprite() which then
            is processed by the renderer itself, breaking down the tasks required to draw a sprite - such as binding data to shaders and dispatching draw calls.
            There is a layer system within the renderer, that allows you to determine in what order, from zero, the order in which sprites are rendered. This allows skipping a depth
            texture and query to see if something can render. As quads are very cheap to render, this speeds up the renderer over using a Z-test. Whilst this may have several overlapping renders
            the quads are rendered in full bright, as explored later in the lighting explanation - making the pixel shader cost virtually a texture lookup.
            Furthermore, the sprite renderer supports flipping, tinting and scaling and UVs for sprite-map lookup.
            <br/>
            Around this, the renderer also has some extra functions that facilitate more of the renderer functionality. These are de/register_texture(),
            register_point/directional_light(), draw_sprite_late() and set_render_camera().
            <br/>
            Registering and deregistering a texture involves utilising the global unique identifier given to each texture fetched by the asset pipeline and
            passing this, along with a void* and texture resolution to the renderer to create a renderer specific resource. For example, in DirectX 11,
            textures need to be bound to a ID3D11ShaderResourceView, whereas this may not be the same in another renderer API. This is then, within the DirectX 11 renderer,
            inserted into a std::map of identifier and SRV.
            <br/>
            Registering point or directional lights passes the data required for each light to be rendered that frame - this is then handled in a separate shader pass.
            By default, the scene is rendered in full bright, and in the Windows version, an extra render-pass occurs, calculating the lighting and then being combined with the full bright
            output.
            <br/>
            Drawing a sprite late draws a sprite after the rest of the rendering has taken place. This is used to render the cursor correctly, on top of all things on the screen.
            <br/>
            Finally, setting the render camera sets which camera should be used to render the scene. A quirk of this is that if there are multiple cameras, and more than one is
            active, the last camera called will be the one that is rendered with.
            <br/><br/>
            To facilitate much of the previously discussed engine features, wrappers around DirectX 11 datatypes were created.
            <br/>
            For example, SRVResource was created to wrap data management for a ID3D11ShaderResourceView. This provides a few helper functions to manage a ID3D11ShaderResourceView.
            Lighting can have many lights passed to the renderer, SRVResource can be used to resize the ID3D11ShaderResourceView at a rate of 2(n), as well as mapping to the GPU.
            <br/>
            Others include BufferResource for ID3D11Buffer and Texture2DResource for ID3D11Texture2D, ID3D11RenderTargetView and ID3D11ShaderResourceView.
        </p>

        <h3 class="major centerTitle">Scene Graph, Game Object and Component System</h3>
        <p>
            The Scene Graph, Game Object and Component system are heavily connected, with the Scene Graph containing Game Objects which contain Components.
            The Scene Graph is responsible for the correct creation and destruction of Game Objects as well as querying the Scene for Game Objects.
            <br/>
            Game Objects are a critical feature as they contain Components, which provide functionality to the whole engine.
            Game Objects use perfect forwarding to perform in-place construction of Components on the Game Object itself. This avoids creating and copying Components
            and tethers a Component to a GameObject concretely. This combined with C++20's Concepts means that compile-time checks for add_component(type, args)
            ensures that the Component is constructable.
            <br/>
            The Game Object is also responsible for determining the functionality required by the Component.
            Components can have several events that can be added - these are on_begin(), on_remove(), on_update(), on_fixed_update(), on_draw(), on_collision_enter() and on_collision_exit().
            These events are not part of the parent class BaseComponent, but instead is checked if it exists at run-time, through templates - using std::same_as.
            This has the bonus of not having to do a v-table look up for every Component in the scene, as well as, if it does not get compiled away, calling empty functions.

            <br/><br/>
            Based on work performed for the Component-creation system, the Tile Map Component functions in a similar way - with it being able to hold any component type within,
            and construct it with emplacement.
            This means that the Tile Map Component is completely independent to the implementations of each component and wraps the functionality of each one inside of it.
            In almost functions like a Game Object, in that way.
