            <p>
                As a Mech Pilot, you're deployed to a terrorist incident in the city.
                <br>
                Your job as a battle-hardened mech pilot is to defend the city and destroy the terrorists.
                <br>
                They may be heavily armed so take weapons and resources from the ruins of their mechs.
                <br>
                Good luck.
            </p>
            <h3 class="major centerTitle">Background</h3>
            <p>
                This was a project I was given in the first year of my Games Programming Course at Staffordshire
                University,
                we were tasked with creating a Mech-Shooter from the framework provided - called Mech Head.
                <br><br>
                This was given to use to teach us how to use Unreal (4) and how Blueprints work. As this was a
                Foundation Year project it was used as a way to teach people the "flow" of programming.
                <br><br>
                The framework given was bare-bones and I had to create my own Weapons and Enemies from the
                assets and built-in blueprints provided. I learned very quickly from the base blueprints
                and adapted them to suit my needs. Originally, the player could not pick up enemies weapons,
                however as a way of both providing the player with different weapons in a diagetic fashion, I
                decided to add the functionality.
                <br><br>
                Enemies also did not drop anything on death - like Ammo or Health, so I added a system that - based on
                what the enemies main weapon's ammo type was - dropped the ammo on the ground when the mech gets
                destroyed.
                The system also allowed for me to create my own drops so I could control how much resources
                were provided to the player, so I could create a sense of scarcity with ammo while giving the player
                enough to get through the level without running out of ammo (unless they waste ammo).
                <br><br>
                The weapon information popup that is displayed when you hover over a weapon was modified to include
                additional data about the weapon, originally only the damage and which arm it was for.
                I added data such as rate of fire, ammo cost per shot and ammo type.
