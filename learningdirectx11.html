                        <br>
                        Your job as a battle-hardened mech pilot is to defend the city and destroy the terrorists.

                        They may be heavily armed so take weapons and resources from the ruins of their mechs.

                        Good luck.

                    <h3 class="major">Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was a project I was given in the first year of my Games Programming Course at Staffordshire University,
                        we were tasked with creating a Mech-Shooter from the framework provided - called Mech Head.
                        <br><br>
                        This was given to use to teach us how to use Unreal (4) and how Blueprints work. As this was a
                        Foundation Year project it was used as a way to teach people the "flow" of programming.
                        <br><br>
                        The framework given was bare-bones and I had to create my own Weapons and Enemies from the
                        assets and built-in blueprints provided. I learned very quickly from the base blueprints
                        and adapted them to suit my needs. Originally, the player could not pick up enemies weapons,
                        however as a way of both providing the player with different weapons in a diagetic fashion, I
                        decided to add the functionality.
                        <br><br>
                        Enemies also did not drop anything on death - like Ammo or Health, so I added a system that - based on
                        what the enemies main weapon's ammo type was - dropped the ammo on the ground when the mech gets destroyed.
                        The system also allowed for me to create my own drops so I could control how much resources
                        were provided to the player so I could create a sense of scarsity with ammo while giving the player
                        enough to get through the level without running out of ammo (unless they waste ammo).
                        <br><br>
                        The weapon infomation popup that is displayed when you hover over a weapon was modified to include
                        additional data about the weapon, originally only the damage and which arm it was for.
                        I added data such as rate of fire, ammo cost per shot and ammo type.
                    </p>
